# battletyper
A terminal game for 2 players. Combines concepts from typing games and turn-based RPGs.
Could be combined into far fewer files, this was my first C++ project.
Allows for players to select a class and play against one another on the same machine.

Tracks turns and creates a history of the previous games played.
